## Purpose

The idea of this repository is to port or start these discussions on GitHub. Being on GitHub, it is easier to search for answers to questions already answered by these groups.

The goal is to unify all discussions in one place, and GitHub was chosen for that.


## Advantages of GitHub

* Space used by almost all developers
* It's a social network
* The search works very well
* Scalable
* Organizable

## Help and be remembered!

Every time someone asks a question and their answer is marked as correct, you earn a point and can appear in the ranking of the people who help you the most.

In addition, your GitHub profile will also show you how many discussions you have already answered!

## Guidelines and Good Practices

Before creating a question / discussion, you should pay attention to the following guidelines:

### Search

An essential skill for developers is knowing how to do good research. Many beginner's questions can be answered with simple surveys, so before posting your question make sure you have done the necessary research and bring the data you found and the data you did not find into the question / discussion.

#### Search the forum

1. Use the search function at the top of this repository (make sure you are not in a * fork *)

2. Research nearby subjects, perhaps your question may have been answered in a similar question / discussion

#### Search the Internet

1. If your question is about a specific language or tool, look for your question in the official documentation of that language / tool

2. If the item above does not resolve, preferably use [Google](https://www.google.com)

3. Try to search, write and awnser in English, even if you need to use [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com)

4. Give preference to results from official documentation and specialized forums, example:
  * [HerbsJS Documentation](https://herbsjs.org)
  * [StackOverflow] (https://stackoverflow.com/)

### Other points

* Try to write English correctly and well punctuated.
* Avoid leaving the initial scope of the question / discussion. If necessary, create a new question / discussion and mention the question / discussion.
* If you need help with a code, provide excerpts, [Gists](https://gist.github.com/), and remember, no one has an obligation to solve your problem.
* Don't be a monologue that only talks about you. Interact with responses, quote people, generate a healthy and constructive discussion. After all, the more information, the richer our environment will be and will help more people.

## When to create a Question / Discussion?

### Doubts

Focus your questions on real problems. Include details about what you tried and exactly what you are trying to do.

The ideal is that before creating a question you try to solve the problem yourself, in most cases a brief in our documentation a small search can help you find a solution.

Ask about:
- How to solve a certain problem eg: `How to change the behavior of use case`.
- How to perform a certain task eg: `How to consume a REST webservice with herbs`.
- How to optimize a piece of code eg: `How to use the glues and plugins of herbs`.

Remember to do a lot of research before opening a question / discussion, there are good chances that your question has already been answered and is documented over the internet.

### Discussions

Discussions are always welcome, when formulating a discussion, try to be as direct as possible about what you intend to address, if necessary open more than one thread, one for each subject.

### General

If your post does not fit into any of the above categories, no problem. As long as it deals with herbsjs or related subject, we will be willing to discuss and help. And you can open it with the [discussion category](https://github.com/herbsjs/forum/discussions/categories/general).

## Was your question answered?

If someone answered your question correctly, be sure to mark the answer as answered. This helps to filter the questions, in addition to giving a point to the colleague who helped you and encouraging people to help each other more and more.

</p>

After selecting the category, just add a very detailed title and neat the text. Remember to follow [the correct steps](CONTRIBUTING.md) when creating a question / discussion.

## Code of conduct

Like any discussion group, there are some rules that must be followed to provide a better experience for everyone.

* Respect to be respected. Do not write anything that might offend someone. Reflect if the text is not aggressive / rude before sending.
* Keep criticism of ideas, not people.
* No harassment or discrimination related to personal characteristics or choices will be allowed, as well as bullying, sexism, racism or any other type of action that may cause embarrassment to other participants.

Behave professionally. Participants who violate these rules will be asked to withdraw or banned due to the seriousness of their actions.
